can be categorized into four types based on its capabilities: systems that think like humans, systems that think rationally, systems that act like humans, and systems that act rationally.\n- \"Thinking like humans\" refers to mimicking human cognitive processes, while \"thinking rationally\" involves logical reasoning and problem-solving.\n- \"Acting like humans\" encompasses behaviors and actions that resemble human responses, whereas \"acting rationally\" focuses on achieving goals through optimal decision-making.\n- Understanding these categories is crucial for distinguishing between different AI applications and their underlying methodologies.\n\nSlide 5:\n- Turing's 1950 paper introduces the question of machine intelligence through the Imitation Game, assessing if machines can behave intelligently rather than think.\n- The Turing test involves an interrogator distinguishing between a human and a machine based solely on responses, predicting a 30% success rate for machines by 2000.\n- Turing anticipated significant arguments against AI development over the next 50 years, highlighting the ongoing debate in the field.\n- Key components of AI identified by Turing include knowledge, reasoning, language understanding, and learning, which remain foundational in AI research.\n- Critique of the Turing test: it lacks reproducibility, constructive methodology, and is not suitable for mathematical analysis, limiting its effectiveness as a definitive measure of intelligence.\n\nSlide 6:\n- The 1960s cognitive revolution marked a shift from behaviorism to information-processing psychology, emphasizing the need for scientific theories of brain activities.\n- Key questions in cognitive science include the appropriate level of abstraction (knowledge vs. circuits) and methods for validation through either top-down behavioral predictions or bottom-up neurological data.\n- Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience are distinct from AI, yet all three fields currently lack theories that achieve or explain human-level general intelligence.\n\nSlide 7:\n- Normative thinking focuses on what constitutes correct arguments and thought processes, as opposed to merely describing how people think.\n- Aristotle's contributions laid the groundwork for various Greek schools of logic, which established notation and rules for logical derivation.\n- The evolution of logic through mathematics and philosophy has a direct influence on the development of modern AI.\n- Key problems in rational thinking include the fact that not all intelligent behavior relies on logical reasoning and the challenge of determining the purpose and selection of thoughts.\n\nSlide 8:\n- Rational behavior is defined as actions taken to maximize goal achievement based on available information.\n- Rational actions do not always require conscious thought; automatic responses (e.g., reflexes) can also be considered rational.\n- Aristotle's perspective in Nicomachean Ethics emphasizes that all actions and inquiries aim at achieving some form of good.\n- The concept of rationality includes the idea that thinking should facilitate and support rational actions.\n- Understanding rational behavior involves recognizing the distinction between instinctual responses and deliberate decision-making processes.\n\nSlide 9:\n- An agent is defined as an entity that perceives its environment and acts upon it, forming the basis for rational agent design.\n- The function representing an agent is expressed as f: P∗ → A, where P∗ denotes percept histories and A represents actions.\n- The goal is to identify the agent or class of agents that achieves optimal performance within specified environments and tasks.\n- Perfect rationality is unattainable due to computational limitations, necessitating the design of the best program within available machine resources.\n\nSlide 10:\n- AI prehistory encompasses foundational disciplines such as philosophy, mathematics, and psychology, which contribute to understanding reasoning, learning, and language.\n- Key concepts include formal representation and proof, algorithms, computation, and the study of (un)decidability and (in)tractability in problem-solving.\n- The role of probability and adaptation is crucial in AI, influencing how systems learn from data and adjust to new information.\n- Knowledge representation and grammar are essential for developing AI systems that can understand and generate human language effectively.\n- Control theory principles, including homeostatic systems and stability, inform the design of optimal agents in AI, focusing on maintaining balance and functionality in dynamic environments.\n\nSlide 11:\n- 1943: McCulloch & Pitts developed a Boolean circuit model of the brain, laying foundational concepts for neural networks.\n- 1950: Alan Turing published “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,” introducing the Turing Test as a criterion for machine intelligence.\n- 1956: The Dartmouth meeting marked the formal adoption of the term \"Artificial Intelligence\" and set the stage for future research.\n- 1980-88: The expert systems industry experienced significant growth, driven by advancements in knowledge-based systems.\n- 1988-93: The AI Winter occurred, characterized by a decline in funding and interest in AI due to unmet expectations.\n- 1985-95: A resurgence of neural networks occurred, alongside a renewed focus on probabilistic methods and the emergence of \"Nouvelle AI.\"\n\nSlide 12:\n- Current AI technology can
