operating system?\", \"choices\": [\"A program in execution\", \"A static program\", \"A set of instructions\", \"A hardware component\"], \"answer_index\": 0, \"explanation\": \"A process is defined as a program in execution, which includes the program code, current activity, and associated resources.\", \"source\": \"Slide 1\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following is NOT a state of a process?\", \"choices\": [\"New\", \"Ready\", \"Running\", \"Idle\"], \"answer_index\": 3, \"explanation\": \"Idle is not a defined state of a process; the valid states are New, Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated.\", \"source\": \"Slide 8\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the role of the Process Control Block (PCB)?\", \"choices\": [\"Manage CPU registers\", \"Store process state information\", \"Allocate memory\", \"All of the above\"], \"answer_index\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The PCB manages various aspects of a process, including state information, CPU registers, and memory management data.\", \"source\": \"Slide 10\"}, {\"question\": \"Which scheduling algorithm is characterized by serving processes in the order they arrive?\", \"choices\": [\"SJF\", \"Round Robin\", \"FCFS\", \"Priority Scheduling\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling serves processes in the order they arrive in the ready queue.\", \"source\": \"Slide 15\"}, {\"question\": \"What is context switching?\", \"choices\": [\"Switching between different CPUs\", \"Saving and loading process states\", \"Changing process priorities\", \"Allocating memory to processes\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Context switching is the process of saving the state of a currently running process and loading the state of the next scheduled process.\", \"source\": \"Slide 16\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following is a characteristic of the 'Waiting' state?\", \"choices\": [\"Process is executing\", \"Process is ready to run\", \"Process is paused for an event\", \"Process has completed execution\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"In the 'Waiting' state, a process is paused and waiting for an event, such as I/O completion, to proceed.\", \"source\": \"Slide 8\"}, {\"question\": \"What does the stack of a process hold?\", \"choices\": [\"Global variables\", \"Function parameters and return addresses\", \"Executable code\", \"Dynamic memory allocations\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"The stack holds function parameters, return addresses, and local variables, which are essential for function execution.\", \"source\": \"Slide 4\"}, {\"question\": \"Which IPC method is considered safer and easier to manage?\", \"choices\": [\"Shared memory\", \"Message passing\", \"Pipes\", \"Sockets\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Message passing is considered safer and easier to manage compared to shared memory, which requires synchronization.\", \"source\": \"Slide 3\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the main purpose of process scheduling?\", \"choices\": [\"To allocate memory\", \"To manage CPU time allocation\", \"To create new processes\", \"To terminate processes\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Process scheduling is primarily concerned with allocating CPU time to various processes to ensure efficient execution.\", \"source\": \"Slide 15\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the significance of the 'Ready' state?\", \"choices\": [\"Process is executing\", \"Process is waiting for I/O\", \"Process is prepared to execute\", \"Process has terminated\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"The 'Ready' state indicates that a process is prepared to execute but is waiting for CPU allocation.\", \"source\": \"Slide 8\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following is a disadvantage of frequent context switching?\", \"choices\": [\"Increased CPU utilization\", \"Decreased system responsiveness\", \"Increased CPU time spent on switching\", \"Improved process management\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Frequent context switching can lead to performance degradation due to increased CPU time spent on switching rather than executing processes.\", \"source\": \"Slide 16\"}, {\"question\": \"What does the heap segment of a process do?\", \"choices\": [\"Stores global variables\", \"Contains executable code\", \"Allows dynamic memory allocation\", \"Holds function parameters\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"The heap segment is used for dynamic memory allocation, allowing programs to request and release memory at runtime.\", \"source\": \"Slide 7\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the primary function of interprocess communication (IPC)?\", \"choices\": [\"To manage memory\", \"To synchronize processes\", \"To allocate CPU time\", \"To create new processes\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"IPC mechanisms are essential for synchronizing processes and facilitating data exchange between them.\", \"source\": \"Slide 2\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following is NOT a component of the PCB?\", \"choices\": [\"Process state\", \"Program counter\", \"I/O status\", \"User interface\"], \"answer_index\": 3, \"explanation\": \"The PCB contains process state, program counter, and I/O status, but does not include a user interface.\", \"source\": \"Slide 10\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the role of the 'time_slice' field in the Linux task_struct?\", \"choices\": [\"Indicates process priority\", \"Determines CPU allocation time\", \"Stores process state\", \"Links to parent process\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"'time_slice' determines how long a process can run before being preempted by the scheduler.\", \"source\": \"Slide 12\"}, {\"question\": \"Which scheduling algorithm is designed to minimize turnaround time?\", \"choices\": [\"Round Robin\", \"SJF\", \"FCFS\", \"Priority Scheduling\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling aims to minimize turnaround time by executing the shortest processes first.\", \"source\": \"Slide 15\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the primary purpose of the ready queue?\", \"choices\": [\"To hold processes waiting for I/O\", \"To contain processes ready to execute\", \"To manage terminated processes\", \"To store process control blocks\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"The ready queue contains processes that are ready to execute and waiting for CPU time.\", \"source\": \"Slide 14\"}]}"}
