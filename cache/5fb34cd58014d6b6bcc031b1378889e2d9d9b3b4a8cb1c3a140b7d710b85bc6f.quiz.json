limited information\", \"Agents can predict all outcomes\", \"Agents always act optimally\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"Bounded rationality refers to the concept that agents make decisions based on the best available information, even if it is incomplete.\", \"source\": \"Slide 7\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following environments is considered dynamic?\", \"choices\": [\"Backgammon\", \"Solitaire\", \"Internet shopping\", \"Chess\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Internet shopping is dynamic because conditions can change in real-time, such as product availability and user behavior.\", \"source\": \"Slide 16\"}, {\"question\": \"What is the main focus of the performance measure in the PEAS framework?\", \"choices\": [\"To define the environment\", \"To evaluate the agent's effectiveness\", \"To describe the actuators\", \"To identify the sensors\"], \"answer_index\": 1, \"explanation\": \"The performance measure in the PEAS framework evaluates

operates\", \"Agents do not interact\", \"Multiple agents may interact with each other\", \"It is always deterministic\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"A multi-agent environment involves multiple agents that may interact with each other, affecting their decision-making processes.\", \"source\": \"Slide 15\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following is an example of a partially observable environment?\", \"choices\": [\"Backgammon\", \"Solitaire\", \"Taxi services\", \"Chess\"], \"answer_index\": 2, \"explanation\": \"Taxi services are partially observable because the agent
