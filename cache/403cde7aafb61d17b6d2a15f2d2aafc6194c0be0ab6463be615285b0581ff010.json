The historical evolution of AI features key milestones such as the Turing Test, the development of neural networks, and the emergence of deep learning. Ethical considerations, including bias, privacy, and employment effects, are critical in AI discourse. AI can be categorized based on capabilities: systems that think or act like humans and those that think or act rationally. Current advancements enable AI to perform complex tasks, such as playing table tennis and navigating autonomous vehicles, showcasing real-time decision-making and spatial awareness. However, limitations remain in areas like strategic gameplay in bridge and abstract reasoning in mathematics, indicating ongoing challenges in achieving human-level general intelligence.", "cards_json": "{\"cards\": [{\"type\": \"definition\", \"front\": \"What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\", \"back\": \"AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems, including learning, reasoning, and self-correction.\", \"source\": \"Slide 1\"}, {\"type\": \"definition\", \"front\": \"What are the key components of AI?\", \"back\": \"The key components of AI include machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.\", \"source\": \"Slide 2\"}, {\"type\": \"qa\", \"front\": \"What significant milestone did Turing introduce in 1950?\", \"back\": \"Turing introduced the Turing Test as a criterion for machine intelligence.\", \"source\": \"Slide 5\"}, {\"type\": \"definition\", \"front\": \"What is the Turing Test?\", \"back\": \"The Turing Test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.\", \"source\": \"Slide 5\"}, {\"type\": \"definition\", \"front\": \"What are the four types of AI based on capabilities?\", \"back\": \"1.
