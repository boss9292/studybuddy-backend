of color and shading to enhance visual appeal.\n- Utilize scanning or photography techniques that maintain the integrity and clarity of the original drawings.\n- Consider the audience and purpose of the pictorial representation to tailor the style and complexity accordingly.\n- Label key elements in the drawings to provide context and facilitate understanding of the depicted ideas.\n\nSlide 2:\n- Define the structure for the proposed layout, including key components such as data types, variables, and their relationships.\n- Write pseudocode for each problem, ensuring to include clear function definitions, control structures (loops, conditionals), and input/output specifications.\n- Identify potential errors for each pseudocode segment, including syntax errors, logical errors, and runtime errors, and suggest ways to handle or mitigate them.\n- Ensure that the pseudocode is modular, promoting reusability and clarity, with appropriate comments explaining each section's purpose.\n- Validate the pseudocode against edge cases and constraints specified in the problem to ensure robustness and correctness.\n\nSlide 3:\n- Identify key themes and concepts presented in the text.\n-
