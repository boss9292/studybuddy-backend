Implement `InitTesting()` to set up resources for concurrency before executing tasks.\n2. Use `StudentWriteDelegate()` with file handling functions (`fopen()`, `fwrite()`) as a function pointer for writing image data.\n3. Optimize `WriteImage()` for performance by leveraging concurrency, ensuring thread safety and adherence to library constraints.\n4. Ensure `WriteToImageFile()` does not exceed `MAX_BLOCK_SIZE` bytes per call to prevent runtime errors.\n5. Include debugging outputs to track file writing sections without relying on execution order.\n6. Test implementations on at least 4 processors, confirming parallel execution and measuring performance metrics.\n7. The program processes multiple images (c.jpg, m.jpg, o.jpg, p.jpg) sequentially, reporting errors and confirming successful writes for some files.\n8. Performance metrics indicate efficient execution with minimal CPU time, suggesting effective threading and processing.\n9. The output includes clear testing demarcations and block indices, highlighting the complexity of image handling and threading efficiency.\n10. Confirm successful processing of images with timing metrics indicating efficient execution despite the complexity of operations.", "cards_json": "{\"cards\": [{\"type\": \"definition\", \"front\":
