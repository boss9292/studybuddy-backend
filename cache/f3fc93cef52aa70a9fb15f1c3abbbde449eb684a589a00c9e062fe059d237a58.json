Key components include the kernel, user interface, system calls, and file systems. OS types encompass batch, time-sharing, distributed, real-time, and embedded systems. The OS acts as an intermediary between hardware (CPU, memory, I/O devices) and application programs, facilitating user interactions.\n\nThe architecture of computer systems involves multiple CPUs and device controllers connected via a bus, allowing concurrent execution and efficient resource allocation. Interrupts play a crucial role in managing hardware interactions, enabling the CPU to handle multiple tasks effectively. The OS uses device drivers for I/O operations, managing data transfer and ensuring system responsiveness.\n\nStorage systems are organized hierarchically, with main memory (RAM) providing fast access and secondary storage (HDDs, SSDs) offering larger capacity. Caching improves performance by storing frequently accessed data in faster memory. Understanding these concepts is vital for analyzing OS functionality across various computing environments, including servers, desktops, and mobile devices.", "cards_json": "{\"cards\": [{\"type\":
