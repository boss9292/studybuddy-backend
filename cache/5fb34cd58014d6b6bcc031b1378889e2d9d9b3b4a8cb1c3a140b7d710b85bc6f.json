They can be categorized into four types: simple reflex agents, model-based agents, goal-based agents, and utility-based agents, each differing in decision-making complexity. The architecture of intelligent agents involves a perception-action cycle, where the agent function maps percept histories to actions. Rationality in agents is defined by their ability to act optimally based on available information, balancing performance measures against computational resources.\n\nAgents operate within environments characterized by factors such as observability (fully or partially observable), determinism (predictable vs. stochastic), episodicity (independent vs. sequential actions), static vs. dynamic conditions, and single-agent vs. multi-agent scenarios. The PEAS framework (Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors) is essential for understanding agent design and functionality. Performance measures evaluate agent effectiveness, while the environment provides context for actions. Agents must adapt to their environments, making strategic decisions to maximize their performance based on the given criteria.", "cards_json": "{\"cards\": [{\"type\": \"definition\", \"front\":
